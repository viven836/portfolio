# Personal Portfolio – Eesha Karpuradu

Welcome to my personal portfolio website!  
This is my little space on the internet where I showcase my projects, skills, and everything I love building 💖

## ✨ About
I’m an Information Technology student who loves creating thoughtful, aesthetic, and meaningful tech projects.  
This site is built completely with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and designed with love, creativity, and way too much perfectionism 😭✨

## Projects Featured
- **MediQuick** – AI + IoT emergency bed allocation system  
- **Rosella** – PCOS prediction app  
- **SpeakUp** – A platform to improve public speaking confidence  
- **Bubbl** – Hate speech detection & positive social media experience  
- and more…

Each project card flips on hover and takes you to the GitHub repo when clicked!

## Tech Stack
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- Custom illustrations & a carefully crafted colour palette 💫
